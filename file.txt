Certainly, here's an updated section to address the availability of third-party solutions:

**Limitations in GitHub Actions:**

1. **Concurrent Job Termination:**
   - *Current Behavior:* When a new job arrives in the same concurrency group as a running job, GitHub Actions terminates the existing job with the intention of allowing the new job to run immediately.
   - *Desired State:* The desired behavior is for jobs to wait in line, without terminating currently running jobs, and to execute sequentially once the previous job completes.

2. **Lack of Job Queuing:**
   - *Current Behavior:* GitHub Actions does not provide a built-in job queuing mechanism, resulting in the immediate initiation of the new job, leading to potential interference with the execution order.
   - *Desired State:* The requirement is for jobs to be queued in the order of arrival, waiting for their turn to execute after the completion of the preceding jobs.

3. **Inability to Preserve Job Order:**
   - *Current Behavior:* The existing concurrency model in GitHub Actions does not inherently support preserving the order of job execution when triggered in parallel.
   - *Desired State:* The desired state involves preserving the order of job execution, ensuring that jobs are executed in the sequence they were triggered.

**Third-Party Solutions:**
While the desired state can be achieved through certain third-party marketplace actions, it is important to note that the current limitations are inherent in the core GitHub Actions functionality. The use of third-party solutions may introduce additional dependencies and complexities to the workflow. Moreover, relying on external solutions may not align with the firm's preference for a native and officially supported feature set.

It is recommended to explore third-party options cautiously, considering potential implications related to compatibility, support, and security.

These limitations collectively impact our ability to achieve a more controlled and orderly workflow execution, particularly in scenarios where jobs need to wait in a queue and run sequentially without interference.

If there are any further details or adjustments needed, please let me know.
