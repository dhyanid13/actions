**Practical Test Update: Jenkins Pipeline Implementation**

Implemented a Jenkins pipeline comprising two stages:

1. **Initializer:** Sets up a shared file.
2. **ReadWrite:** Performs read/write operations on the shared file and sleeps for 2 minutes.

Applied a `lock` at the stage level and a `milestone` after it to synchronize access to the shared file. Tested parallel triggers and observed successful synchronizationâ€”ensured the second triggers did not enter the second stage until the first operation completed.

Conducted a comparative test without using `lock` and `milestone`, resulting in a clear demonstration of race conditions occurring.

Confirmed: The use of `lock` and `milestone` effectively prevents race conditions, ensuring synchronized execution and data integrity among parallel tasks in Jenkins pipelines.

**Technical Test Update: Jenkins Pipeline Implementation**

Implemented a Jenkins pipeline architecture with distinct stages:

1. **Initializer Stage:** Configured the initial setup, establishing a shared file for subsequent operations.
2. **ReadWrite Stage:** Executed read/write operations on the shared file and incorporated a 2-minute sleep interval.

Applied a `lock` at the stage granularity to enforce exclusive access to the shared file and strategically placed a `milestone` subsequent to the locked section. The aim was to orchestrate synchronization within the pipeline's concurrent sections.

Conducted rigorous testing by triggering parallel operations. Notably, the observed behavior demonstrated effective synchronization, as subsequent triggers refrained from entering the second stage until the completion of the initial operation.

A comparative analysis was also performed, deliberately omitting the `lock` and `milestone` constructs. The outcome starkly revealed the emergence of race conditions, affirming the critical necessity of these mechanisms.

This practical test unequivocally verifies the robustness of `lock` and `milestone` implementations in Jenkins. They decisively avert race conditions, guaranteeing synchronized execution and data coherence across parallel tasks within the pipeline architecture.
