To effectively use a TCP proxy for HTTP(S) traffic in a scenario like fetching JWKS, you would typically need to ensure the following:

Your Proxy Server Configuration: Your firm's proxy server should be configured to handle outbound TCP connections from Envoy and route them to the correct HTTP(S) destination based on the destination IP address, port, or other identifiable information in the TCP stream.

DNS Resolution: Ensure that DNS resolution for the JWKS endpoint (login.microsoftonline.com in your case) is handled in a way that directs Envoy to route the traffic through the TCP proxy. This might involve DNS overrides or specific network routing rules.

Encryption and Security: If the JWKS endpoint uses HTTPS (which is typical for secure JWKS fetching), your TCP proxy setup needs to handle TLS encryption/decryption appropriately, either by terminating TLS at the proxy or by using a tunneling method that preserves end-to-end encryption.

Given these considerations, using a TCP proxy for routing HTTP(S) JWKS requests is less straightforward than managing HTTP(S) traffic directly, due to the additional complexity of correctly handling HTTP(S) requests at the TCP level and ensuring secure, accurate routing of requests to their intended destination.
